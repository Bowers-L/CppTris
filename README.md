# SDL_Template

Note: This project is currently under development and only built for Windows / Visual Studio 2022.

If you want to compile the project in VS and run it, you must copy the SDL2.dll and SDL2_image.dll files located in the "vendor" folder into the "bin" directory containing your executable. This will be fixed in the future once I integrate a build system into the project.
