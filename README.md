# CppTris

The goal of this project is to create a version of Tetris that runs in a custom C++ engine using SDL with OpenGL for Rendering.

This is the third of a series of projects I've done over the years to remake Tetris in various graphics environments.

The other two are:
1. Java Processing - https://github.com/Bowers-L/TetrisPi
2. Game Boy Advance - https://github.com/Bowers-L/GBA-Tris

Note: This project is currently under development and only built for Windows / Visual Studio 2022.

The project has been updated with a Premake Lua script to build the project files. Run the Generate.bat script (double click in Windows) to generate the project files for Visual Studio.
